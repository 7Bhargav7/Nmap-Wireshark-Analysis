## 🔍 SYN Stealth Scan Overview

### 🕵️ What is a SYN Stealth Scan?
A SYN stealth scan (half-open scan) is a sophisticated network reconnaissance technique that allows attackers or security professionals to map open ports with minimal detection risk.

## 🛡️ Technical Mechanism

### Two-Way Handshake vs Traditional Three-Way Handshake

#### Traditional Three-Way Handshake
1. Client sends SYN
2. Server responds with SYN-ACK
3. Client sends ACK
4. Full connection established

#### SYN Stealth Scan Approach
1. Client sends SYN packet
2. Server responds with SYN-ACK
3. Client sends RST (Reset) instead of ACK
4. Connection terminated before completion

### 🔬 Key Characteristics
- **Minimal Logging**: Prevents full connection logging
- **Reduced Detectability**: Interrupts connection before completion
- **Quick Scanning**: Faster than full connection scans

## 🌐 Real-World Scanning Scenarios

### Penetration Testing
- **Network Mapping**: Identify open ports without triggering extensive logging
- **Firewall Testing**: Assess network perimeter security
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Quick port state determination

### Defensive Security
- **Network Reconnaissance**: Understand potential entry points
- **Security Auditing**: Identify unexposed services
- **Proactive Vulnerability Management**

## 🚨 Ethical Considerations

### Legal and Ethical Boundaries
- **Authorized Use Only**: Always obtain explicit permission
- **Consent is Critical**: Unauthorized scanning can be illegal
- **Professional Context**: Used in controlled security assessments
