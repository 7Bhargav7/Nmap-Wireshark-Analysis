## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a structured learning journey to deeply understand network scanning techniques using Nmap in a controlled, ethical laboratory environment.

## 🎓 Learning Approach

### 🔬 Methodology
- Hands-on experimentation with Nmap scanning techniques
- Systematic documentation of scan results
- Analyzing network behaviors and vulnerabilities
- Building practical cybersecurity skills

## 🛠 Lab Environment

### Infrastructure
- **Scanner**: Kali Linux
- **Target**: Metasploitable
- **Networking**: Oracle VirtualBox Host-Only Adapter

## 🔎 Nmap Commands & References

### 🌐 Basic Scans
- `nmap -sn` → Ping Scan
- `nmap -p-` → Full Port Scan
- `nmap -sV` → Service Version Detection

### 🥷 Stealth Techniques
- `nmap -sS` → SYN Stealth Scan
- `nmap -f` → Fragmentation Scan

### 🕵️ Advanced Scans
- `nmap -A` → Aggressive Scanning
- `nmap -O` → OS Detection

### 🛡️ Evasion Methods
- `nmap -D` → Decoy Scanning
- `nmap --data-length` → Firewall Evasion
